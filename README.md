# Running the program

If you do not have Rust installed follow the instructions listed [HERE](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) to get up and running.

Once installed you'll want to check out the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Willlumps/452-project-2.git
cd 452-project-2
```
With `cargo` installed, you can simply run:
```
cargo run
```
